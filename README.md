plants = [] → stores the names of your plants

growth = [] → keeps track of how much each plant has grown

plant_seed() → asks for a name and plants a new seed

water_plants() → increases the growth level of all plants

show_garden() → displays the garden status

main() → shows the menu and handles user input
